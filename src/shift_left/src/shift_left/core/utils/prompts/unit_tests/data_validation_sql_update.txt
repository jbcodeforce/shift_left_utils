Your goal is to tune the validation SQL to assess if a test success or not.

Follow the following workflow for the validation SQL:

1. Analyze the DML script to test for the elements to retrieve
2. Using existing input SQL scripts, update the `expected_results` Common Table Expression to match the elements to retrieve from the DML to test
3. Update the validation statement

The DML under test: {dml_content}

The validation statement to update: {validation_content}

The insert statments are in the following list of input:

{input_tables}
