# Shift Left tools and practices

## Introduction

Shift Left means taking bach-processing jobs and try to refactor them to real-time processing using a product such as Apache Flink. In batch processing a lot of projects use SQL and dbt (Data build tool) to define the logic of the data pipeline. In real-time processing, Apache Kafka is a de-facto middleware to persist immutable records, and for SQL, Python and Java based real-time processing, Apache Flink is also the preferred platform.

To organize batch processing and data pipelines to Datawarehouse, some compagnies are using the [Kimball guidelines](https://www.kimballgroup.com/data-warehouse-business-intelligence-resources/kimball-techniques/dimensional-modeling-techniques/) and best practices.

Two important concepts of this practice:

* **Dimensions** provide the “who, what, where, when, why, and how” context surrounding a business process event. Dimension tables contain the descriptive attributes used by BI applications for ﬁltering and grouping the facts. 
* **Facts** are the measurements that result from a business process event and are almost always numeric. The design of a fact table is entirely based on a physical activity, and not by the reports to produce from those facts. A fact table always contains foreign keys for each of its associated dimensions, as well as optional degenerate dimension keys and date/time stamps

## Context

The target environment will be Apache Flink running within the Confluent Cloud as a managed service. The source of the batch processing is defined within a dbt (Data build tool) project.
